# longcat-tiled-set

Here's a silly tile set for making loopy long cats.

I dont remember the exact original source, I think it was an ancient chan thread. But file obtained from https://www.indiedb.com/games/destination-facepunch/images/longcat-full-size#imagebox

I dont own it, just some fairuse tinkering, so respect the original work as best you can.
